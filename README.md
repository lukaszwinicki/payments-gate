## 💳 Payment Processor Integration

Payments Gate supports seamless integration with multiple payment processors: **TPay**, **Paynow**, and **Noda**. Each processor is implemented as a dedicated service that adheres to a shared `PaymentMethodInterface`, enabling unified handling of transaction logic (create, confirm, refund) across providers.

``` php
interface PaymentMethodInterface
{
    public function create(array $transactionBody): ?CreateTransactionDto;
    public function confirm(array $webHookBody, array $headers): ?ConfirmTransactionDto;
    public function refund(array $refundBody): ?RefundPaymentDto;
}
```

### 🧩 Architecture Overview

The integration uses the **Factory Pattern** to dynamically resolve the appropriate payment provider service based on the selected payment method:

```php
public static function getInstanceByPaymentMethod(?PaymentMethod $paymentMethod): PaymentMethodInterface
    {
        return match ($paymentMethod) {
            PaymentMethod::PAYMENT_METHOD_TPAY => App::make(TPayService::class),
            PaymentMethod::PAYMENT_METHOD_PAYNOW => App::make(PaynowService::class),
            PaymentMethod::PAYMENT_METHOD_NODA => App::make(NodaService::class),
            default => throw new NotImplementedException("Payment method " . ($paymentMethod) . " is not implemented.")
        };
    }
```

## Authentication – API Key & Secret Key

To access and use the **Payments Gate API**, clients must authenticate using an API Key and Secret Key, which are generated by the system during account or application registration.

### 🔐 How Authentication Works

- Upon registration, each client receives:
  - **API Key** – public identifier used to make requests
  - **Secret Key** – private credential used to sign requests

- These credentials are required for every request to protected endpoints.


### 🔧 Getting Your Keys

1. Register or log into your account on the Payments Gate dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Profiles -> Access Keys**.
3. Look view your:
   - `API_KEY`
   - `SECRET_KEY`

You should store these securely and never expose your Secret Key publicly.

### 📡 Making Authenticated Requests

All requests to the Payments Gate API must include:

- `Headers: x-api-keys : <API_KEY>`

## 🔐 Webhook Signature Verification

Payments Gate sends webhook notifications to your backend when the transaction status changes. To ensure authenticity, each request includes a `signature` field – an HMAC-SHA256 hash created using your **Secret Key**.

### ✅ How the Signature Is Generated

The signature is calculated on the server side as follows:

```php
$status = 'SUCCESS';
$transaction_uuid = 'abc-123-xyz';
$merchantSecretKey = 'your-merchant-secret-key';

$signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $status . $transaction_uuid, $merchantSecretKey);
```
